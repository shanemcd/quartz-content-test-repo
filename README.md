This repo was created to test out the ability to store content for a Quartz site
in a separate Git repository.

I attempted to fix this in https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/pull/1853
and https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/pull/1791, both of which were closed
without actually fixing the issue. Hopefully this will at least let the
maintainers of Quartz verify the functionality so the issue can be fixed to
their liking.

To test this out, simply run this command from the root of this repo:

```
$ make
```
